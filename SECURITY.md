# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of our project seriously and appreciate your efforts to help us maintain a secure environment for all users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not create a public GitHub issue. Public disclosure can expose users to risk before a fix is available.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities directly to our security team via email at **[info@getarcane.app](mailto:info@getarcane.app)**.

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us address vulnerabilities effectively, please provide:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- Information about the affected versions or environments
- Any suggested fixes, workarounds, or mitigations (if available)

### Our Commitment

We will:

- Acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- Investigate and validate the vulnerability promptly
- Work to develop and release a fix as quickly as possible
- Keep you informed of our progress throughout the process

We value responsible disclosure and are grateful for your contribution to the security of our project.
